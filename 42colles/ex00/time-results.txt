those are the execution time comparison between 2 versions of colle00:
1. a version where you print every char when you determined which one it must be, labeled "write"
1. a version where you malloc a string and fill it, and print it only at the end with 1 write() call, labeled "malloc"

the "corner Vx" are just 2 differents ways to check if coord is one of a corner

            write     | malloc
corner v1   1m39.030s   0m2.717s
            1m32.114s   0m2.777s
            1m36.624s   0m2.771s

corner v2   1m31.919s   0m2.418s
            1m31.753s   0m2.740s
            1m31.566s   0m2.740s
